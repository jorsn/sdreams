sdreams --- dream streams for java
========================================

**sdreams** is a bundle of a stream and a "reader" that I have written for
my own java programs. Both shall be used with *text files/character streams*!



Classes
-----------


###MergedCharacterInputStream

This class merges multiple character InputStreams.

It is not really documented but I think the source code is almost
self-explaining if you know the [javadoc of `InputStream`][javadoc-IS],
its superclass.

I am using this class to merge stdin and stdout when using the java compiler API.

[javadoc-IS]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html


###CharsetSensitiveFileToStringReader

*In fact, this is no real `Reader`!*
It is only a class with three static methods of type `String`:

* `readFile(File file)`,
* `readFile(String path)` and 
* `readFile(URI uri)`.

They do all the same: They return the `String` content of a file,
automatically detecting and taking into a count the character set.
Tis is achieved by using [juniversalchardet].

Dependencies
--------------

* Certainly the standard java libs.
* CharsetSensitiveFileToStringReader needs [juniversalchardet].
